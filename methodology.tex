The objective of this paper is to investigate the physical correctness of the Abkowitz model and the Physics informed model when the parameters are identified by inverse dynamics regression (ID regression, \autoref{sec:inverse_dynamics}) on a set of calm water standard manoeuvres. In order to assess the physical correctness, comparisons are made with a third model -- the Reference model. The Reference model has the Physics informed model structure, but with parameters identified with VCT regression (\autoref{sec:VCT_regression}) supported by CFD calculations. The resulting models have been named according to \autoref{tab:model_names}.
The Reference model is assumed to be the more physically correct model, compared to the other two, since it is based on direct CFD calculations of the hydrodynamic forces from a controlled parameter variation.
