\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
The objective of this paper is to investigate the physical correctness of the Abkowitz model and the Semi-empirical model when the parameters are identified by inverse dynamics regression (ID regression, \autoref{sec:inverse_dynamics}) on a set of calm water standard manoeuvres. In order to assess the physical correctness, comparisons are made with a third model -- the Reference model. The Reference model has the Semi-empirical model structure, but with parameters identified with VCT regression (\autoref{sec:VCT_regression}) supported by CFD calculations. The resulting models have been named according to \autoref{tab:model_names}.
The Reference model is assumed to be the more physically correct model, compared to the other two, since it is based on direct CFD calculations of the hydrodynamic forces from a controlled parameter variation. The Reference model is therefore a suitable reference to assess the physical correctness of the two other models.
