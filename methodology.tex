\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
The parameters within the Abkowitz model and the Semi-empirical model structures have been identified with: VCT regression (\autoref{sec:VCT_regression}), and inverse dynamics regression (\autoref{sec:inverse_dynamics}). The resulting models have been named following a  naming convention based on the model structure and the type of regression applied according to \autoref{tab:model_names}.
\begin{table}[h!]
    \caption{Model names are defined by the model structure and regression type.}

    \begin{tabular}{l l l}
        Model name & Structure & Regression \\
        \hline
        Semi-empirical VCT & Semi-empirical & VCT \\
        Semi-empirical ID & Semi-empirical & ID \\
%        Abkowitz VCT & Abkowitz & VCT \\
        Abkowitz ID & Abkowitz & ID \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
The Semi-empirical VCT is assumed to be the more physically correct model, since it is based on direct measurements of the hydrodynamic forces from a controlled parameter variation. The idea is that this model can serve as a reference to the two other inverse dynamics models.
