% Move 1 - Background/introduction/situation
System identification offers ways to obtain proper models describing a ship's dynamics in real operational conditions, but also poses some major challenges, such as multicollinearity and generality of the identified model. 

% Move 2 - Present research/purpose
This paper proposes a new physics informed ship manoeuvring model, where a deterministic semi-empirical rudder model has been added, to guide the identification towards a physically correct hydrodynamic model.  
This is an essential building block to distinguish the hydrodynamic modelling uncertainties from wind, waves, and currents -- in real sea conditions -- which is particularly important for ships with wind-assisted propulsion.
In the physics informed manoeuvring modeling framework, a systematical procedure is developed to establish various force/motion components within the manoeuvring system by the inverse dynamics regression.

The novel test case wind powered pure car carrier (wPCC) is used to assess the physical correctness. First, a reference model, assumed to resemble the physically correct kinetics, is established via parameter identification on virtual captive tests. Then, the model tests are used to build both the physics informed model and a physics uninformed mathematical model for comparison.

% Move 4 - Results/findings
All of the models predicted the zigzag tests with satisfactory agreement and can thus indeed be considered as being mathematically correct; However, the introduction of a semi-empirical rudder model seems to have guided the identification towards a more physically correct calm water hydrodynamic model, with lower multicollinearity and better generalization.
