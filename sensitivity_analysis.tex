The sensitivity of the ID regression was studied for the PU and PI models, to see how sensitive they are to small changes in the data.
The model test data was filtered with EKF:s with different covariance matrices of the process noise \textbf{Q} and observation noise \textbf{R}. The observation noise \textbf{R} was varied by changing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) according to \autoref{eq:SNR}, where a larger SNR gives a smaller \textbf{R}, so that the EKF thereby relies more on the model test data than the predictor model.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:SNR}
    \mathbf{R} = \frac{\mathbf{Q}}{SNR}
\end{equation}
Accelerations of the filtered data from one of the zigzag tests with the covariance varied by SNR=0.1, 1, and 10, are shown in \autoref{fig:SNR_sensitivity.accelerations}. SNR=10 relies more on the data and therefore contains more of the measurement noise.

Identified hull coefficients from the data filter variations are shown in \autoref{tab:pivot}.

Large differences was observed for the PU model, especially in the identified yaw coefficients ${N}'_r,{N}'_v$ (also shown in \autoref{fig:SNR}) where ${N}'_v$ even has the wrong sign for SNR=0.1, and SNR=1.0. The identified values of the PI model is more stable during the variations. Th PI model is therefore more robust and less sensitive to small variations in the data.
