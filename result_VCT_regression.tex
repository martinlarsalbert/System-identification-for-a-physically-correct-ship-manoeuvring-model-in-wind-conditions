\subsection{Reference model}
\label{sec:result_VCT_regression}
Before assessing the physical correctness of the ID regression models, the physical correctness of the Reference model must first be assessed. Standard manoeuvring model tests are used for this purpose. As a first step, total forces and moments from the model test are estimates with inverse dynamics (see \autoref{sec:inverse_dynamics}). These forces can be compared with corresponding forces predicted with the Reference model. 
\autoref{fig:VCT_regression_ID} shows such a comparison for a zigzag20/20 model test. The first graph shows the rudder signal $\delta$ together with drift angle $\beta$ and yaw rate $r$. A comparison of sway force $Y_D$ and yawing moment $N_D$ are shown in the other two graphs. The forces and moments predicted with the Reference model are in reasonable agreement with the forces from the experiment. There are small deviations, where the Reference model over predicts the forces and moments in the peaks -- in the ends of the counter rudder excitations. 
The predicted force signals seem to have the same general shape as the experimental forces, which implies that the Reference model captures most of the essential physics involved in the experiment.
Comparisons with the other tests are summarized as the mean average error in \autoref{tab:reference_model_mean_average_error}. The other zigzag20/20 has about the same error as the one in \autoref{fig:VCT_regression_ID}. For the zigzag10/10 tests, the errors are smaller, which is also the case for the yaw rate and reference speed tests.

and is therefore a relevant reference, when the physical correctness of the ID regressions should be assessed.
