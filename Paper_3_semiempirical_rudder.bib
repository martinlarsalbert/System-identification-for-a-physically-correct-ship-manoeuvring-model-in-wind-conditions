	abstract = {A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called “MMG standard method”. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

	abstract = {Wind propulsion for commercial ships has been identified as a key component in the energy transition for the maritime industry. The sailing hybrid ship will operate with leeway (drift) angles to produce a lateral force known as sideforce, for steady operation under sail. In this paper, experimental results for the sailing performance of ships fitted with bilge keel appendages are presented. Systematic variations in appendage height, length, and position were tested, including several special cases (multiple bilge keels). The appendage typology is shown to mitigate the strong ‘destabilizing’ yaw moment that is characteristic of wind-assisted commercial vessels and to promote the non-linear sideforce component. The working principal for bilge keels—promotion of flow separation—can be employed to specify the separation location for components of the vessel vortex wake to improve the sailing performance of the ship.},

	abstract = {Demanding marine operations increases the complexity of maneuvering. A highly accurate dynamic ship model
permits predicting ship motions and therefore advancing control safety and maneuverability for the offshore ship
system. To adequately simulate the maneuvering motion of a real vessel, it is crucial to identify the uncertain
hydrodynamic coefficients to establish highly accurate mathematical models. In this paper, a support vector machine
method is proposed for the hydrodynamic parameter identification of a nonlinear maneuvering model for a surface
vessel. To improve the stability and generalization performance of the identification model, multiple zigzag
maneuvering datasets are included as training data. The 3-DOF hydrodynamic derivatives are identified and
validated by the multiple support vector regression model. The generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear
model is explored by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the original maneuvering data on the
evaluation dataset, a dataset that contains separate variable zigzag and turning circle maneuvers tests. The
satisfactory agreements between predicted motions and original motions demonstrate the validity and generalization
capability of the proposed parameter identification method.},

The experimental data as well should be set-up in an input file. The benchmark automatically creates input files for the chosen manoeuvring software, runs the software and manages the output files. It reads from these outputs, collects the model test measurements and plots the results. Some test-cases are presented in the paper, showing the potentialities and flexibility of the benchmark. To this purpose a manoeuvring prediction program is used as example and its theory briefly explained. Its simulations are then compared with the benchmark of experimental data.},

	abstract = {In many situations the manoeuvering performance of ships is largely effected by the non-linear contributions of the hydrodynamic reaction forces on the hull. The origin of these non-linear components can be ascertained from experiments with segmented models. In this paper a review is given of the analysis of the segmented model tests which have been reported in literature so far. From the results derived from this analysis it will be shown that the non-linear hull force and moment components can be described in a robust manner by means of a longitudinal distribution of the so-called cross-flow drag coefficient. Thus, a good description of the ship's manoeuvrability is acquired for the entire speed range of a vessel, including the transition from the manoeuvres at service speed with relatively small drift angles to the manoeuvres at reduced speed (harbour manoeuvering) with large drift angles.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study is to investigate the turning and zig-zag maneuvering performance of the well-known naval surface combatant DTMB (David Taylor Model Basin) 5415 hull with URANS (Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) method. Numerical simulations of static drift tests have been performed by a commercial RANS solver based on a finite volume method (FVM) in an unsteady manner. The fluid flow is considered as 3-D, incompressible and fully turbulent. Hydrodynamic analyses have been carried out for a fixed Froude number 0.28. During the analyses, the free surface effects have been taken into account using VOF (Volume of Fluid) method and the hull is considered as fixed. First, the code has been validated with the available experimental data in literature. After validation, static drift, static rudder and drift and rudder tests have been simulated. The forces and moments acting on the hull have been computed with URANS approach. Numerical results have been applied to determine the hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients, such as, velocity terms and rudder terms. The acceleration, angular velocity and cross-coupled terms have been taken from the available experimental data. A computer program has been developed to apply a fast maneuvering simulation technique. Abkowitz’s non-linear mathematical model has been used to calculate the forces and moment acting on the hull during the maneuvering motion. Euler method on the other hand has been applied to solve the simultaneous differential equations. Turning and zig-zag maneuvering simulations have been carried out and the maneuvering characteristics have been determined and the numerical simulation results have been compared with the available data in literature. In addition, viscous effects have been investigated using Eulerian approach for several static drift cases.},

	abstract = {In order to develop tools for analysis of the current matters a study on hydrodynamic forces on a semi-planing monohull in following and stern quartering seas has been performed. The present thesis is based on the work described by the listing below: • Development of a method for testing and evaluation of a ship in full-scale or a free running ship model. • A scale model was tested in various regular waves as well as a few irregular waves consisting of two and three components. The model was fixed in the surge, sway, roll and yaw directions but free to heave and pitch. This setup gave possibility to measure the most important forces and still having a realistic displacement, or wetted surface, for the ship model. This test methodology gives opportunity to use a relatively limited number of model trials for identifying conditions where surf riding and broaching-to are likely to occur. The purpose with the trials is also to validate numerical computations of hydrodynamic forces. • Numerical computations using a code based on a modified strip theory and semiempirical methods. • A comparison of computations and the experimental work.},

To verify the effectiveness of PLS parametric identification method in processing data with high dimensionality and heavy multicollinearity, the identified results of the hydrodynamic derivatives from the simulated 20 deg/20 deg zigzag test are compared with the planar motion mechanism (PMM) test results. The performance of PLS regression is also compared with that of the conventional least squares (LS) regression using the same dataset.

	abstract = {Modeling is the most important component in predictive controller design. It should predict outputs precisely and fast. Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible. In a good ship model the standard deviation of a particular coefﬁcient should not exceed 10\% of its value. Fitting the validation data to 80\% for short-term prediction and 65\% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to ﬁt the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identiﬁcation procedure is proposed. In the ﬁrst step a predictive linear model is identiﬁed conventionally, and then coefﬁcients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefﬁcient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100\% of their values to approximately 5\% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71\% and 54\% to 89\% and 76\%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufﬁciently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

	abstract = {Digital Twins have much attention in the shipping industry, attempting to support all phases of a vessel’s life cycle. With several tools appearing in Digital Twin software suites, high-quality manoeuvring and performance prediction remain cornerstones. Propulsion efficiency is in focus while in service. Simulator-based training is in focus to ensure safety of manoeuvring in confined waters and harbours. Prediction of ships’ velocity and turn rate are essential for correct look and feel during training, but phenomena like dynamic inflow to propellers, bank and shallow water effects limit simulators’ accuracy, and master mariners often comment that simulations could be in better agreement with actual behaviours of their vessel. This paper focuses on digital twin enhancements to better match reality. Using data logged during in-service operation, we first consider a system identification perspective, employing a first-principles model structure. Showing that a complete first-principles model is not identifiable under the excitation met in service, we employ a Recurrent Neural Network to predict deviations between measured velocities and the model output. The outcome is a hybrid of a first-principles model with a machine learning generic approximator add-on. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy of both in-harbour manoeuvring and shallow water passage conditions.},

Here, we present a robust nonparametric system identification technique for a ship maneuvering model based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression. To solve the problem caused by noise, the input noisy Gaussian Process (NIGP) model is employed, and it can automatically propagate the input uncertainty to the output in the learning model using the Taylor approxi­ mation. Polluted simulation datasets obtained from the numerical model of a parametric container ship are used for training. Zigzag and turning circle maneuvering motions are performed, and a comparison with GP and SVM is implemented to validate the proposed approach. The results indicate that the developed scheme for system identification of ships is accurate and robust with noisy input.},

cause in the field of statistical learning. To diminish the

using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). By utilizing the multiple
datasets including those from zigzag and turning tests and the
combinations of manoeuvres, as well as the data processed by
D-optimizing design or difference method, the VIF is applied to
quantify the severity of collinearity of different model
structures. The results show that the selected manoeuvring
models have high collinearity under the data of single standard
manoeuvre. The pre-processed test data and an appropriate
model structure can alleviate the collinearity, hence to diminish the parameter drift. However, the collinearity of the selected
models cannot be eliminated. Some suggestions are given for
selecting more appropriate training data and mathematical

For the KVLCC test case, two stern shape variants named KVLCC1 and KVLCC2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and CFD for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided PMM and CMT data, and two used CFD instead. CFD-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with PMM/CMT model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as PMM- and CMT-based methods, CFD based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different CFD-based methods such as RANS, URANS, and DES.

The hydrodynamic derivatives in an Abkowitz model are determined by the Lagrangian factors and the support vectors in the SVM regression model. To obtain the optimized structural factors in SVM, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated into SVM. To diminish the drift of hydrodynamic derivatives after regression, a difference method is adopted to reconstruct the training samples before identification. The validity of the difference method is verified by correlation analysis. Based on the Abkowitz mathematical model, the simulation of ship maneuvering motion is conducted. Comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates the validity of the proposed methods in this paper.},

	abstract = {Determination of ship maneuvering models is a tough task of ship maneuverability prediction. Among several prime approaches of estimating ship maneuvering models, system identification combined with the full‐scale or free‐ running model test is preferred. In this contribution, real‐time system identification programs using recursive identification method, such as the recursive least square method (RLS), are exerted for on‐line identification of ship maneuvering models. However, this method seriously depends on the objects of study and initial values of identified parameters. To overcome this, an intelligent technology, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), is firstly used to estimate initial values of the identified parameters with finite samples. As real measured motion data of the Mariner class ship always involve noise from sensors and external disturbances, the zigzag simulation test data include a substantial quantity of Gaussian white noise. Wavelet method and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are used to filter the data corrupted by noise, respectively. The choice of the sample number for SVM to decide initial values of identified parameters is extensively discussed and analyzed. With de‐noised motion data as input‐output training samples, parameters of ship maneuvering models are estimated using RLS and SVM‐RLS, respectively. The comparison between identification results and true values of parameters demonstrates that both the identified ship maneuvering models from RLS and SVM‐RLS have reasonable agreements with simulated motions of the ship, and the increment of the sample for SVM positively affects the identification results. Furthermore, SVM‐RLS using data de‐noised by EMD shows the highest accuracy and best convergence.},

When the results were compared with the model test and system-based method, the free running simulation showed better agreement to that of the model test.

RDE had emerged earlier in the study of the second variations in the calculus of variations, but its use in general linear systems, where the optimal trajectory needs to be generated by a control input, was new. The analysis throughout the paper concentrates on timevarying systems, and uses the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to arrive at RDE and to deduce optimality of the LQ control gain. We now know, however, that an alternative way to prove optimality in least squares is by showing how RDE allows one to "complete the square" (see, e.g., [5], [18]).},

	doi = {10.3390/s21237910},
	abstract = {Small USVs are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most USV systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two GNSS antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small USV systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an RTK GNSS receiver is used. The drawback of the RTK solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter (EKF) aided by GNSS latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground (COG), speed over ground (SOG), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a USV. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four EKF covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different GNSS receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the EKF is that the autopilot does not need to use the COG and SOG measurements from the GNSS receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to the EKF to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state EKF is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial USV systems.},

The present work focuses on the investigation of the importance of free surface assessment on the estimation of the hydrodynamic forces, particularly, in the presence of the ship–bottom interaction and when certain parameters are varied, including the ship’s speed and the drift angle. This investigation aims, in particular, to mark off the confidence Interval of neglecting free surface deformation hypothesis by comparing the results of static drift test with and without considering this assumption. The study was carried on a 135 m inland containership at a scale ratio of 1:25 undergoing static drift tests. In order to recreate the ship–bottom interaction, the depth to draft ratio (h/T) is varied to obtain four channel configurations. The tests are performed by numerical code under the commercial software Ansys Fluent by solving Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equations(RANSE) coupled to a \$\$k -{\textbackslash}omega\$\$SST turbulence model. To investigate the effect of free surface modelling, the hydrodynamic forces are compared when the free surface separating air and water is considered, using Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method, and when the free surface is neglected. The simulations are carried out for various ship speeds and various drift angles.},

	abstract = {This research deals with the simulation of ship’s maneuvering performance in adverse weather conditions. A 4-DoF (surge, sway, yaw and heel) nonlinear maneuvering model is formulated and solved in the time domain by use of MATLAB’s software environment, in which several subsystems referring to the calculation of the hull, propeller and rudder forces/moments are integrated. The maneuvering derivatives and forces/moments are being estimated by use of model experimental data, of semi-empirical relationships and the application of potential theory 3D panel codes and CFD-RANS solvers. The wave-induced forces/moments are herein considered through the mean second order wave forces/moments, which are pre-calculated and provided to the maneuvering simulation solver as response surfaces. The validation of the theoretical/numerical approaches is demonstrated by in depth studies on the maneuvering coefficients and on typical maneuvers of the DTC containership in waves and the KVLCC2 tanker. Associated model experiments were conducted by MARINTEK for the DTC containership and CEHIPAR for the KVLCC2 tanker under the EU funded project SHOPERA.},

Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.},

Both models are trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of more than 15,000 30-minute-long motion observation windows from two research vessels at sea in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Three different hindcast weather services are used, including two models from the EU’s Copernicus system and NOAA’s WAVEWATCH III. The evaluation shows that a tradeoff exists between the formulations, with the black-box formulation offering higher accuracy and the cost of less transparency. The weather hindcast used has a small impact on the results, and the ability of both models to generalize predictions between near-sister ships is also encouraging for the practical application of these techniques.},

The surge, sway and yaw motions of the ship are influenced by the second order wave drift forces and moments calculated based on a potential flow solver. Propeller thrust, rudder and hydrodynamic forces and moments are computed using empirical formulas available in the literature. For path following purposes, waypoints are assigned in head and beam wave conditions and a line of sight algorithm computes the reference heading angle.

The performance of the nonlinear model predictive controller is compared against that of a basic PID controller.},

	title = {Sailing {Performance} of {Wind}-{Powered} {Cargo} {Vessel} in {Unsteady} {Condi}- tions},
	abstract = {The need to reduce green-house gas emissions from shipping has reborn the interest in wind propulsion for commercial cargo vessels. This places new requirements on the tools used in ship design, as well as the methods usually applied in sailing yacht design. A range of design tools are used by designers at various stages in the design of wind-assisted ships and for different purposes. One important tool is the steady-state velocity prediction program (VPP) which is typically used to predict the speed of the vessel when sailing in a range of wind directions and wind speeds. Steadystate VPPs are very efficient and fast and may be used to rapidly assess a large number of design alternatives. While being very efficient, steady-state VPPs are not able to consider dynamic effects such as unsteady wave forces on the hull which may require the rudder to be active to control the heading and course of the vessel. This, in turn, leads to different mean forces than those predicted by a static VPP and therefore the sailing performance may be reduced compared to the predictions of a static VPP. Another effect of the ship’s motions in a seaway is that the angles of attack of the sails fluctuate, which can lead to different optimum sheeting angles and possibly a loss of performance. This study used an unsteady 3D fully nonlinear potential flow hydrodynamic model coupled with an efficient lifting-line aerodynamic model to investigate the differences in sailing performance of a vessel sailing in steady conditions to the performance when sailing in a seaway and gusty wind based on a spatio-temporal wind model. The analysis showed clearly that the unsteady wind model affected the predicted performance. This was especially the case on a beam reach, where large changes in the local sail angles of attack could be observed.},

Effect of nonuniform flow around ships on deformation of short waves is taken into account, and reflection region of short waves around ships' hull is clarified in the method. One of features of the method is that it explains effects of maneuvering motion on steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves by regarding them as effects of nonuniform flow around ships in maneuvering motion on short waves' refraction and reflection. It is also noticeable that integral region to calculate steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves is defined clearly. Results are compared with experimental data for a very large crude oil carrier (VLCC) model test and the presented method is confirmed to be practically useful to predict steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves acting on ships in maneuvering motion. Ship form effects are investigated by comparing calculation for the VLCC and a training ship. The calculation method is considered to be applicable to estimate not only steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves acting on ships in maneuvering motion, but also maneuvering motion of ships in short waves by time simulation.},

This study considers the effect of regular sea waves on ship’s initial turning parameters at the set of service conditions. By means of free running model tests the influence of low advance speed on course and maneuvering trajectory changes in transient turning motion were investigated. The effects of the wave encounter angle variations were examined during the tests, including application of different wave lengths. Using the experimental results, an attempt was made to normalize the ship's handling in adverse sea conditions by applying a simple criterion based on the initial time to reach a given course. The results of the present study can be used for benchmarking of numerical simulations of low speed maneuvers in regular waves.},

In order to establish a more realistic ship manoeuvring model, it will be a vital task to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients while considering the effect of environmental disturbances, such as the wind. To account for the measurable wind perturbation which current research often neglects, in this paper, a deterministic model is constructed, based on which the SVM method is implemented to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients. The parameter identification is conducted on a 3-degree of freedom Abkowitz model using data collected from a sequential zigzag manoeuvre, and the results are verified against the benchmark value. The model performance is further validated by trajectory comparisons. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method in cases where the wind speed is less than 8m/s and the measurement noise is less than 13\%.},

As it is impossible to comprehensively validate model performance, a reliable model must be built within a consistent range with similar ships’ models. However, in the SI approach, models are greatly influenced by the dataset design and feature selection, leading to the instability of model identification and the failure to ensure such consistency. To address this issue, our new idea introduces similar ship’s model into model identification as knowledge foundation. First, we select a similar ship with three-step procedure, then build a new model by refining model parameters for a similar ship. Such a refinement is conducted with additional l2 regularization term in ridge regression, which balances knowledge and data-driven refinement. Designing the safe range of such refinement with hyperparameters, this study helps designers find a robust-and-accurate model within designed safe zones. In simulation experiments, we built knowledge connection between 161 m and 175 m container ships. By using the well-validated model of the former, a robust-and-accurate model for the latter was easily built by using a limited dataset, resulting in excellent model performance. This study makes the SI approach more promising by incorporating knowledge connections between similar ships.},

	abstract = {Assessing the manoeuvring performances of a ship at a design stage is becoming more important, especially when trying to improve shipping efficiency to reduce fuel consumption.
When designing a hull with appendages, it is necessary to balance hydrodynamic efficiency with manoeuvrability. Therefore, the possibility of simulating a captive test at a design stage will increase the chances of understanding the behaviour of a ship from an early stage in the design process. The current research is based on the evaluation of hydrodynamic efficiency of a hull and appendages in a pure resistance, self-propulsion and in a wind-assisted mode.
The forces and moments acting on the hull and appendages are then analysed and used as inputs for a Virtual Captive Test (VCT) [1]. In order to correctly perform a VCT and further analyse the performances of a ship with a Velocity Prediction Programme (VPP), particular care has been put in correctly capturing the manoeuvrability coefficients. Those are derived with polynomial fittings once the forces and moments acting on the ship are extracted from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
Many CFD simulations were performed to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull and appendages in a range of flow directions, rudder angles and rotating flow. Those simulations encompass the whole range of datapoints needed to describe a wind-assisted ship during manoeuvring.
Taking into consideration both hydrodynamic characteristics and manoeuvrability effects at an early design stage can reduce model tests costs and will allow to inspect a larger number of hull-appendages scenarios when analysing the final VPP results.},

	abstract = {System identification provides an effective way to predict the ship manoeuvrability. In this paper several measures are proposed to diminish the parameter drift in the parametric identification of ship manoeuvring models. The drift of linear hydrodynamic coefficients can be accounted for from the point of view of dynamic cancellation, while the drift of nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients is explained from the point of view of regression analysis. To diminish the parameter drift, reconstruction of the samples and modification of the mathematical model of ship manoeuvring motion are carried out. Difference method and the method of additional excitation are proposed to reconstruct the samples. Using correlation analysis, the structure of a manoeuvring model is simplified. Combined with the measures proposed, support vector machines based identification is employed to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients in a modified Abkowitz model. Experimental data from the free-running model tests of a KVLCC2 ship are analyzed and the hydrodynamic coefficients are identified. Based on the regressive model, simulation of manoeuvres is conducted. Comparison between the simulation results and the experimental results demonstrates the validity of the proposed measures.},

Implicit models of manoeuvring motion are derived from the SVM regression instead of using the traditional methods for identification of the hydrodynamic coefficients. Data obtained from full-scale trials are used for regression analysis. Disturbances induced by current and wind are estimated. At the training stage, the inputs to the SVMs are the surge speed, sway speed, yaw rate and rudder angle, while the outputs are the derivatives of the surge speed, sway speed and yaw rate, respectively. At the simulation stage a predictive model is constructed with the obtained support vectors, Lagrangian factors and a constant. The Gauss function kernel is employed in the SVMs to guarantee the performance of the approximation and the robustness of the SVM regressor. The turning circle manoeuvre is simulated based on the regression manoeuvring models. Comparisons between the trials and the simulated results are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed modelling method.},

In the procedure, not only the ship motion data but also the wind data are used for making up a CARX (Continuous Auto Regressive eXogenous) model. The main advantage of the procedure is that the coefficients of the model directly correspond to the hydrodynamic derivatives. The identification algorithm consists of the IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) digital filters and RLS (Recursive Least Square) method. To discuss the reliability of the identified coefficients, the procedure is applied to a full-scale ship's data and the results are compared to the hydrodynamic derivatives provided by the shipbuilding company. Moreover, a simple navigation support system is proposed using the identified hydrodynamic derivatives. The system can indicate the ship manoeuvrable range under wind conditions and its usefulness is shown.},

	abstract = {Model uncertainty is pervasive and inherent in the engineering field. It could bring potential risks in real applications, especially for ship behaviour prediction under environmental disturbances. The evaluation and quantification of model uncertainty are of importance for accurate ship motion prediction. This study applies model uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis methods to evaluate the ship motion model's level of uncertainty against environmental disturbances and ship manoeuvres. Firstly, three models are created based on the a dynamical model (Mariner) in Marine Systems Simulator. After that, models are tested on various predefined scenarios. The similarity of predicted tra-jectories and the reference is evaluated by Euclidean distance and used to quantify the uncertainty of models. Next, statistical analysis is used to analyze the uncertainty of models. Sensitivity analysis (SA) method called 'PAWN' and 'UnivariateSpline' interpolation technology are combined to identify which factors contribute the most to model's performance. The results suggest that the uncertainty caused by external factors varies from different models under different manoeuvres. SA can tell us which factors (wind angle, wind velocity, and surge speed) have a large influence to the model uncertainty given a ship maneuver. Such analyses, on the one hand, contribute operators to choosing the optimum model according to the current conditions for better ship motion prediction. On the other hand, they can pick up the most important factors for fast uncertainty modelling.},

	abstract = {Improving the energy efficiency of ships has generated significant research interest due to the need to reduce operational costs and mitigate negative environmental impacts. Numerous hydrodynamic energy saving technologies have been proposed. Their overall performance needs to be assessed prior to implementation. A new approach to this evaluation is investigated at model scale which applies an approach comparable to that applied for the performance monitoring of a full scale ship. That is long duration testing that measures power consumption for given environmental and ship operating conditions and can use statistical analysis of the resultant large amount of data to identify performance gains. As a demonstration of the approach, an autonomous, self-propelled and self-measuring free running ship model of an Ice Class tanker is developed. A series of lake based and towing tank tests experiments have been conducted which included bollard pull, shaft efficiency, naked-hull, self-propulsion, and manoeuvrability tests. These investigated the efficiency improvement resulting from changing the ship operational trim and testing different bow designs. An associated mathematical model for the time domain simulation of the autonomous ship model provides an effective tool for data analysis. It has been demonstrated that the use of a suitably instrumented self-propelled autonomous ship model can provide long duration tests that incorporates the influence of varying environmental conditions and thereby identify marginal gains in ship energy efficiency.},

Traditional test methods of free sailing models are somewhat limited by the difficulties to mimic the effects of the wind propulsion systems or at least for recreating them at the correct scale. Simulations are possible but time consuming and they cannot grasp all aspects that free sailing models comprise. At the KTH Maritime Robotics Laboratory, a 1:30 scale model of Oceanbird was developed and equipped with numerous sensors to enable accurate and realistic measurements while sailing in unrestrained waters. The paper presents the model’s equipment and experimental results showing the abilities of the sailing demonstrator to gather high quality data for manoeuvring and aerodynamic studies. In particular, the definition of a zigzag manoeuvre for sailing ships is explained and results of tests are evaluated regarding manoeuvrability and aerodynamics.},

A majority of the publications in this ﬁeld are based on simulated data. In this paper model test data is used. The identiﬁcation process can be decomposed into ﬁnding a suitable Vessel Manoeuvring Model (VMM) for the hydrodynamic forces and to correctly handle errors from the measurement noise. A Parameter Identiﬁcation Technique (PIT) is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable VMM is found using the PIT with cross-validation on a set of competing VMMs. The PIT uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother. Two case study vessels, wPCC and KVLCC2, with very diﬀerent maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method. Turning circle predictions with the Robust VMMs, trained on zigzag model tests, show good agreement with the corresponding model test results for both ships.},

	abstract = {Maneuverability is an important hydrodynamic performance of a ship, and should be taken into account during the ship design stage. The present study of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations aims to offer a numerical tool for maneuvering prediction with high accuracy. The virtual captive model tests for a model scale KCS container ship are conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computation to obtain the full set of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives in the 3rd-order Abkowitz model. The numerical uncertainty analysis is carried out for the pure sway and yaw–drift tests to verify the numerical accuracy. It is concluded that the lower order Fourier coefficients are preferred in the computation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. Moreover, part of the computed hydrodynamic forces and moments are compared with the available captive model test data, and good agreement is obtained. By substituting the computed hydrodynamic derivatives into the mathematical model, the standard turning and zigzag maneuvers are predicted. By comparing the predicted maneuvering results with the available experimental data and the prediction results by others, it is demonstrated that acceptable prediction accuracy can be achieved with the present method, which shows the effectiveness of the present method in predicting ship maneuverability.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the fundamental properties associated with the Nomoto models. Specifically, the state space model associated with the first order Nomoto model is both observable and controllable. The state space model associated with the second order Nomoto model is also observable; however, it is controllable only if the effective sway time constant is different from the effective yaw time constant. The zero appearing in the transfer function model is found responsible for the overshoot behaviors, which are typical in the yaw rate for large rudder angle steering. This suggests that a second order Nomoto model is more appropriate if the overshoot feature is to be properly modeled. Both the first and second order Nomoto transfer function models are identifiable, with an ill-conditioning problem associated the latter. This makes the first order Nomoto model very popular in the adaptive autopilot applications. Model reduction for a fourth order transfer function ship model describing the sway-yaw-roll dynamics is conducted to reach the second order Nomoto model describing the sway-yaw dynamics and the first order Nomoto model describing the yaw dynamics itself, and the Bode plots for these models are given to show the changes in system frequency response caused by model simplification. Thus, appropriate model structures can be selected according to the intended frequency range of application to meet the modeling accuracy requirements.},

The three coupled maneuvering equations in this model for large tankers contain linear and nonlinear terms and instead of attempting to determine the parameters (i.e. hydrodynamic derivatives) associated with nonlinear terms, all nonlinear terms are clubbed together to form one unknown time function per equation which are sought to be represented by the neural network coefficients. The time series used in training the network are obtained from simulated data of zigzag maneuvers and the proposed method has been applied to these data. The neural network scheme adopted in this work has one middle or hidden layer of neurons and it employs the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. Using the best choices for the number of hidden layer neurons, length of training data, convergence tolerance etc., the performance of the proposed neural network model has been investigated and conclusions drawn.},

The present paper introduces this machine learning technology to the field of marine hydrodynamics for the study of complex potential and viscous flow problems. Examples considered include the forecasting of the seastate elevations and vessel responses using their past time records as “explanatory variables” or “features” and the development of a nonlinear model for the roll restoring, added moment of inertia and viscous damping using the vessel response kinematics from free decay tests as “features”. A key innovation of AI-SVM kernel algorithms is that the nonlinear dependence of the dependent variable on the “features” is embedded into the SVM kernel and its selection plays a key role in the performance of the algorithms. The kernel selection is discussed and its relation to the physics of the marine hydrodynamic flows considered in the present paper is addressed.},

	abstract = {Inverse dynamics is a technique in which measured kinematics and, possibly, external forces are used to calculate net joint torques in a rigid body linked segment model. However, kinematics and forces are usually not consistent due to incorrect modelling assumptions and measurement errors. This is commonly resolved by introducing ‘residual forces and torques’ which compensate for this problem, but do not exist in reality. In this study a constrained optimization algorithm is proposed that finds the kinematics that are mechanically consistent with measured external forces and mimic the measured kinematics as closely as possible. The algorithm was tested on datasets containing planar kinematics and ground reaction forces obtained during human walking at three velocities (0.8 m/s, 1.25 and 1.8 m/s). Before optimization, the residual force and torque were calculated for a typical example. Both showed substantial values, indicating the necessity of developing a mechanically consistent algorithm. The proposed optimization algorithm converged to a solution in which the residual forces and torques were zero, without changing the ground reaction forces and with only minor changes to the measured kinematics. When using a rigid body approach, our algorithm ensures a consistent description of forces and kinematics, thereby improving the validity of calculated net joint torque and power values.},

	abstract = {To obtain an accurate ship maneuverability model for motion prediction and autonomous navigation, a ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction method is proposed based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A Mathematical Model Group (MMG) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test (OTT) and dynamic Circular Motion Test (CMT) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the MMG model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The MMG hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom MMG model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard KRISO Container Ship (KCS). These tests show that the motion prediction and free-running maneuvering results can agree with the standard experimental data well. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An accurately predicted dynamic model is essentially required to design a robust control system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) maneuvering in six degrees of freedom. The dynamic model consists of hydrodynamic derivatives which include inertial and damping coefficients. Traditionally, these coefficients can be estimated through Analytical and Semi-Empirical (ASE) methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and through experiments such as captive or free model testing. Additionally, System Identification (SI) estimators, e.g. extended Kalman filter, are also employed to predict the complete set of parameters. Recently, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost every field of science, supervised machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural network algorithms are also being applied to predict the coefficients with lesser computational cost and higher accuracy. Additionally, AI based parametric and non-parametric modeling of autonomous marine vehicles have also been discussed. Accordingly, the contributions of researchers and scientists, with respect to the evolution and application of these important techniques for marine vehicles, particularly torpedo-shaped AUVs, done over the past more than 75 years, have been thoroughly surveyed and sequentially consolidated in this article. At the end, based on the survey, merits and demerits of each technique over the others have been highlighted and published results have also been discussed to evaluate the effectiveness of these estimation techniques for autonomous underwater vehicles.},
