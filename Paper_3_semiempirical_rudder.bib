	abstract = {A lot of simulation methods based on Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) model for ship maneuvering have been presented. Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called “MMG standard method”. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

	doi = {10.3390/s21237910},
	abstract = {Small USVs are usually equipped with a low-cost navigation sensor suite consisting of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and a magnetic compass. Unfortunately, the magnetic compass is highly susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances. Hence, it should not be used in safety-critical autopilot systems. A gyrocompass, however, is highly reliable, but it is too expensive for most USV systems. It is tempting to compute the heading angle by using two GNSS antennas on the same receiver. Unfortunately, for small USV systems, the distance between the antennas is very small, requiring that an RTK GNSS receiver is used. The drawback of the RTK solution is that it suffers from dropouts due to ionospheric disturbances, multipath, interference, etc. For safety-critical applications, a more robust approach is to estimate the course angle to avoid using the heading angle during path following. The main result of this article is a five-state extended Kalman filter (EKF) aided by GNSS latitude-longitude measurements for estimation of the course over ground (COG), speed over ground (SOG), and course rate. These are the primary signals needed to implement a course autopilot system onboard a USV. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and easy to implement since only four EKF covariance parameters must be specified. The parameters need to be calibrated for different GNSS receivers and vehicle types, but they are not sensitive to the working conditions. Another advantage of the EKF is that the autopilot does not need to use the COG and SOG measurements from the GNSS receiver, which have varying quality and reliability. It is also straightforward to add complementary sensors such as a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) to the EKF to improve the performance further. Finally, the performance of the five-state EKF is demonstrated by experimental testing of two commercial USV systems.},

	abstract = {Modeling is the most important component in predictive controller design. It should predict outputs precisely and fast. Thus, it must be adequate for the ship dynamics while having as simple a structure as possible. In a good ship model the standard deviation of a particular coefﬁcient should not exceed 10\% of its value. Fitting the validation data to 80\% for short-term prediction and 65\% for long-term prediction is treated as a declared benchmark for model usage in ship course predictive controller. Regularization was proposed to ensure better state-space models to ﬁt the real ship dynamics and more accurate standard deviation value control. Usage of the simulation results and real-time trials, as model estimation and validation data, respectively, during the identiﬁcation procedure is proposed. In the ﬁrst step a predictive linear model is identiﬁed conventionally, and then coefﬁcients are regularized, based on the validation data, using a genetic algorithm. Particular linearized model coefﬁcient standard deviations were decreased from more than 100\% of their values to approximately 5\% of them using genetic algorithm tuning. Moreover, the proposed method eliminated model output signal oscillations, which were observed during the validation process based on experimental data, gained during ship trials. Improved mapping of ship dynamics was achieved. Fit to validation data increased from 71\% and 54\% to 89\% and 76\%, respectively, for shortterm and long-term prediction. The proposed method, which may be applied to real applications, is easily applicable and reliable. The tuned model is sufﬁciently suited to plant dynamics and may be used for future predictive control purposes.},

At the KTH Maritime Robotics Laboratory, a 1:30 scale model of Oceanbird was developed and equipped with numerous sensors to enable accurate and realistic measurements while sailing in unrestrained waters. The paper presents the model’s equipment and experimental results showing the abilities of the sailing demonstrator to gather high quality data for manoeuvring and aerodynamic studies.

Numerous hydrodynamic energy saving technologies have been proposed. Their overall performance needs to be assessed prior to implementation. A new approach to this evaluation is investigated at model scale which applies an approach comparable to that applied for the performance monitoring of a full scale ship. That is long duration testing that measures power consumption for given environmental and ship operating conditions and can use statistical analysis of the resultant large amount of data to identify performance gains. As a demonstration of the approach, an autonomous, self-propelled and self-measuring free running ship model of an Ice Class tanker is developed. A series of lake based and towing tank tests experiments have been conducted which included bollard pull, shaft efficiency, naked-hull, self-propulsion, and manoeuvrability tests. These investigated the efficiency improvement resulting from changing the ship operational trim and testing different bow designs. An associated mathematical model for the time domain simulation of the autonomous ship model provides an effective tool for data analysis. It has been demonstrated that the use of a suitably instrumented self-propelled autonomous ship model can provide long duration tests that incorporates the influence of varying environmental conditions and thereby identify marginal gains in ship energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Model uncertainty is pervasive and inherent in the engineering field. It could bring potential risks in real applications, especially for ship behaviour prediction under environmental disturbances. The evaluation and quantification of model uncertainty are of importance for accurate ship motion prediction. This study applies model uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis methods to evaluate the ship motion model's level of uncertainty against environmental disturbances and ship manoeuvres. Firstly, three models are created based on the a dynamical model (Mariner) in Marine Systems Simulator. After that, models are tested on various predefined scenarios. The similarity of predicted tra-jectories and the reference is evaluated by Euclidean distance and used to quantify the uncertainty of models. Next, statistical analysis is used to analyze the uncertainty of models. Sensitivity analysis (SA) method called 'PAWN' and 'UnivariateSpline' interpolation technology are combined to identify which factors contribute the most to model's performance. The results suggest that the uncertainty caused by external factors varies from different models under different manoeuvres. SA can tell us which factors (wind angle, wind velocity, and surge speed) have a large influence to the model uncertainty given a ship maneuver. Such analyses, on the one hand, contribute operators to choosing the optimum model according to the current conditions for better ship motion prediction. On the other hand, they can pick up the most important factors for fast uncertainty modelling.},

	abstract = {Manoeuvring models based on support vector machines (SVMs) are proposed for the manoeuvring simulation of a catamaran. Implicit models of manoeuvring motion are derived from the SVM regression instead of using the traditional methods for identification of the hydrodynamic coefficients. Data obtained from full-scale trials are used for regression analysis. Disturbances induced by current and wind are estimated. At the training stage, the inputs to the SVMs are the surge speed, sway speed, yaw rate and rudder angle, while the outputs are the derivatives of the surge speed, sway speed and yaw rate, respectively. At the simulation stage a predictive model is constructed with the obtained support vectors, Lagrangian factors and a constant. The Gauss function kernel is employed in the SVMs to guarantee the performance of the approximation and the robustness of the SVM regressor. The turning circle manoeuvre is simulated based on the regression manoeuvring models. Comparisons between the trials and the simulated results are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed modelling method.},

	abstract = {System identification provides an effective way to predict the ship manoeuvrability. In this paper several measures are proposed to diminish the parameter drift in the parametric identification of ship manoeuvring models. The drift of linear hydrodynamic coefficients can be accounted for from the point of view of dynamic cancellation, while the drift of nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients is explained from the point of view of regression analysis. To diminish the parameter drift, reconstruction of the samples and modification of the mathematical model of ship manoeuvring motion are carried out. Difference method and the method of additional excitation are proposed to reconstruct the samples. Using correlation analysis, the structure of a manoeuvring model is simplified. Combined with the measures proposed, support vector machines based identification is employed to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients in a modified Abkowitz model. Experimental data from the free-running model tests of a KVLCC2 ship are analyzed and the hydrodynamic coefficients are identified. Based on the regressive model, simulation of manoeuvres is conducted. Comparison between the simulation results and the experimental results demonstrates the validity of the proposed measures.},

The hydrodynamic forces and yaw moment on a KRISO Very Large Crude Carrier (KVLCC2) model have been predicted for a static drift and a pure sway test and validated against benchmark model scale test. Good correlations between the measured and computed force and moment results were observed. On validating the numerical prediction technique, a set of systematic simulations on different size ship models has been carried out for static drift, pure sway and pure yaw tests to study the scale effects on the forces and moments obtained from the captive manoeuvres. From the obtained results, scale effects are found to influence the predictions of surge force and sway force but are not significant in the yaw moment.},

	abstract = {Assessing the manoeuvring performances of a ship at a design stage is becoming more important, especially when trying to improve shipping efficiency to reduce fuel consumption.
When designing a hull with appendages, it is necessary to balance hydrodynamic efficiency with manoeuvrability. Therefore, the possibility of simulating a captive test at a design stage will increase the chances of understanding the behaviour of a ship from an early stage in the design process. The current research is based on the evaluation of hydrodynamic efficiency of a hull and appendages in a pure resistance, self-propulsion and in a wind-assisted mode.
The forces and moments acting on the hull and appendages are then analysed and used as inputs for a Virtual Captive Test (VCT) [1]. In order to correctly perform a VCT and further analyse the performances of a ship with a Velocity Prediction Programme (VPP), particular care has been put in correctly capturing the manoeuvrability coefficients. Those are derived with polynomial fittings once the forces and moments acting on the ship are extracted from the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations.
Many CFD simulations were performed to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull and appendages in a range of flow directions, rudder angles and rotating flow. Those simulations encompass the whole range of datapoints needed to describe a wind-assisted ship during manoeuvring.
Taking into consideration both hydrodynamic characteristics and manoeuvrability effects at an early design stage can reduce model tests costs and will allow to inspect a larger number of hull-appendages scenarios when analysing the final VPP results.},

	abstract = {System identification (SI) approach identifies ship maneuvering models using data from free-running maneuvers. As it is impossible to comprehensively validate model performance, a reliable model must be built within a consistent range with similar ships’ models. However, in the SI approach, models are greatly influenced by the dataset design and feature selection, leading to the instability of model identification and the failure to ensure such consistency. To address this issue, our new idea introduces similar ship’s model into model identification as knowledge foundation. First, we select a similar ship with three-step procedure, then build a new model by refining model parameters for a similar ship. Such a refinement is conducted with additional l2 regularization term in ridge regression, which balances knowledge and data-driven refinement. Designing the safe range of such refinement with hyperparameters, this study helps designers find a robust-and-accurate model within designed safe zones. In simulation experiments, we built knowledge connection between 161 m and 175 m container ships. By using the well-validated model of the former, a robust-and-accurate model for the latter was easily built by using a limited dataset, resulting in excellent model performance. This study makes the SI approach more promising by incorporating knowledge connections between similar ships.},

	abstract = {Due to the recent technological advancement into the ship digitalization and automation, there has been an increasing demand for more accurate determination of the ship mathematical model. In order to establish a more realistic ship manoeuvring model, it will be a vital task to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients while considering the effect of environmental disturbances, such as the wind. To account for the measurable wind perturbation which current research often neglects, in this paper, a deterministic model is constructed, based on which the SVM method is implemented to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients. The parameter identification is conducted on a 3-degree of freedom Abkowitz model using data collected from a sequential zigzag manoeuvre, and the results are verified against the benchmark value. The model performance is further validated by trajectory comparisons. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method in cases where the wind speed is less than 8m/s and the measurement noise is less than 13\%.},

One of the main reasons for this is the fact that, in order to satisfy the EEDI requirements, there is a tendency to reduce the power consumption and the propellers RPM reduction while maintaining existing control means, which results in reduced ship steerability mainly at low speed. This study considers the effect of regular sea waves on ship’s initial turning parameters at the set of service conditions. By means of free running model tests the influence of low advance speed on course and maneuvering trajectory changes in transient turning motion were investigated. The effects of the wave encounter angle variations were examined during the tests, including application of different wave lengths. Using the experimental results, an attempt was made to normalize the ship's handling in adverse sea conditions by applying a simple criterion based on the initial time to reach a given course. The results of the present study can be used for benchmarking of numerical simulations of low speed maneuvers in regular waves.},

Effect of nonuniform flow around ships on deformation of short waves is taken into account, and reflection region of short waves around ships' hull is clarified in the method. One of features of the method is that it explains effects of maneuvering motion on steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves by regarding them as effects of nonuniform flow around ships in maneuvering motion on short waves' refraction and reflection. It is also noticeable that integral region to calculate steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves is defined clearly. Results are compared with experimental data for a very large crude oil carrier (VLCC) model test and the presented method is confirmed to be practically useful to predict steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves acting on ships in maneuvering motion. Ship form effects are investigated by comparing calculation for the VLCC and a training ship. The calculation method is considered to be applicable to estimate not only steady horizontal forces and moment due to short waves acting on ships in maneuvering motion, but also maneuvering motion of ships in short waves by time simulation.},

	title = {Sailing {Performance} of {Wind}-{Powered} {Cargo} {Vessel} in {Unsteady} {Condi}- tions},
	abstract = {The need to reduce green-house gas emissions from shipping has reborn the interest in wind propulsion for commercial cargo vessels. This places new requirements on the tools used in ship design, as well as the methods usually applied in sailing yacht design. A range of design tools are used by designers at various stages in the design of wind-assisted ships and for different purposes. One important tool is the steady-state velocity prediction program (VPP) which is typically used to predict the speed of the vessel when sailing in a range of wind directions and wind speeds. Steadystate VPPs are very efficient and fast and may be used to rapidly assess a large number of design alternatives. While being very efficient, steady-state VPPs are not able to consider dynamic effects such as unsteady wave forces on the hull which may require the rudder to be active to control the heading and course of the vessel. This, in turn, leads to different mean forces than those predicted by a static VPP and therefore the sailing performance may be reduced compared to the predictions of a static VPP. Another effect of the ship’s motions in a seaway is that the angles of attack of the sails fluctuate, which can lead to different optimum sheeting angles and possibly a loss of performance. This study used an unsteady 3D fully nonlinear potential flow hydrodynamic model coupled with an efficient lifting-line aerodynamic model to investigate the differences in sailing performance of a vessel sailing in steady conditions to the performance when sailing in a seaway and gusty wind based on a spatio-temporal wind model. The analysis showed clearly that the unsteady wind model affected the predicted performance. This was especially the case on a beam reach, where large changes in the local sail angles of attack could be observed.},

Propeller thrust, rudder and hydrodynamic forces and moments are computed using empirical formulas available in the literature. For path following purposes, waypoints are assigned in head and beam wave conditions and a line of sight algorithm computes the reference heading angle.

Both models are trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of more than 15,000 30-minute-long motion observation windows from two research vessels at sea in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Three different hindcast weather services are used, including two models from the EU’s Copernicus system and NOAA’s WAVEWATCH III. The evaluation shows that a tradeoff exists between the formulations, with the black-box formulation offering higher accuracy and the cost of less transparency. The weather hindcast used has a small impact on the results, and the ability of both models to generalize predictions between near-sister ships is also encouraging for the practical application of these techniques.},

	abstract = {The proper evaluation of the Rudder–Propeller interactions is mandatory to correctly predict the manoeuvring capability of a modern ship, in particular considering the commonly adopted ship layout (rudder often works in the propeller slipstream). Modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers can provide, not only the performance of the whole system but also an insight into the flow problem. In the present paper, an open-source viscous flow solver has been validated against available literature experimental measurements in different conditions. After an extensive analysis of the numerical influence of the mesh arrangement and the turbulent quantities on the rudder provided forces, the study focused its attention on the forces generated by the rudder varying the propeller loading conditions and the mutual position between the two devices. These analyses give a hint to describe and improve a commonly-used semi-empirical method based on the actuator disk theory. These analyses also demonstrate the ability of these numerical approaches to correctly predict the interaction behaviour in pre-stall conditions with quite reasonable computational requests (proper also for a design stage), giving additional information on the sectional forces distribution along the span-wise rudder direction, useful to further develop a new semi-empirical rudder model.},

	title = {Simulation of the {Maneuvering} {Behavior} of {Ships} in {Adverse} {Weather} {Conditions}},
	abstract = {This research deals with the simulation of ship’s maneuvering performance in adverse weather conditions. A 4-DoF (surge, sway, yaw and heel) nonlinear maneuvering model is formulated and solved in the time domain by use of MATLAB’s software environment, in which several subsystems referring to the calculation of the hull, propeller and rudder forces/moments are integrated. The maneuvering derivatives and forces/moments are being estimated by use of model experimental data, of semi-empirical relationships and the application of potential theory 3D panel codes and CFD-RANS solvers. The wave-induced forces/moments are herein considered through the mean second order wave forces/moments, which are pre-calculated and provided to the maneuvering simulation solver as response surfaces. The validation of the theoretical/numerical approaches is demonstrated by in depth studies on the maneuvering coefficients and on typical maneuvers of the DTC containership in waves and the KVLCC2 tanker. Associated model experiments were conducted by MARINTEK for the DTC containership and CEHIPAR for the KVLCC2 tanker under the EU funded project SHOPERA.},
