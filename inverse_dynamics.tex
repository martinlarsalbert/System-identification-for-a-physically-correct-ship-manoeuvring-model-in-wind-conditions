Inverse dynamics is a technique to estimate the total forces ($X_D,Y_D,N_D$) acting on a ship during a certain motion. The technique can be applied on data from a free model manoeuvring tests or data obtained from a real ship. The total forces are calculated from the kinematics of the manoeuvring model (\autoref{eq:X} to \autoref{eq:N}). These equations require that the full state of the ship is known -- so that data on the position and orientation of the ship as well as the higher states: velocity, and accelerations, are needed.
Only the position and orientation of the ship model where however measured during the model tests.
The higher states therefore needed to be be estimated with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) -- where the manoeuvring model was used as the predictor \citep{alexandersson_wpcc_2022}.

The estimated inverse dynamics forces was regressed with ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple
linear regression to identify the parameters of a model. This parameter identification technique is referred to as inverse dynamics (ID) regression in this paper.
