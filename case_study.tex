The wind powered car carrier (WPCC) has wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP) and can alter between a fully sailing mode, and a fully motoring mode -- and all in between. 
In this paper however, only the motoring mode is considered. Due to the WASP, the WPCC design differs a bit from conventional motoring cargo ship designs; The WPCC has two very large rudders -- the rudders are two to three times as large as they would need to be for a conventional ships.
