Some points to consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correct added mass is important when inverse dynamics is used.
    \item Persistence of excitation -- the zigzag test is not very informative \citep{sutulo_algorithm_2014}.
    \item For instance Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) \citep{landau_digital_2006} is more informative.
    \item It has been shown in this paper that the Physics informed model seems to have a better generalization than the pure mathematical Abkowitz model. A pure mathematical model still has the benefit of being very easy to regress, compared to
          identifying the parameters within the semi-empirical rudder model. The semi-empirical rudder model was however treated as a deterministic model in this paper, so that parameter identification on the rudder model itself was not needed. The flow straightening coefficients $\kappa_v$, and $\kappa_r$ where however determined from the VCT data.

    \item The fact that correlation does not imply causality is an aspect that is often overlooked when optimization is conducted based on black box ML models.
\end{itemize}
