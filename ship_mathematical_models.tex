The two different manoeuvring models have the same hull and propeller models but different rudder models either:
a mathematical rudder model, or a new semi-empirical rudder model.
The ship manoeuvring model equipped with the mathematical rudder model is referred to as: the Abkowitz model. The other model, equipped with the semi-empirical rudder, is referred to as: the Physics informed model. Except that the manoeuvring models have different rudder models, the rest of the models are similar to the MMG model \citep{yasukawa_introduction_2015}, with some exceptions that are be presented in the next section.
