In this section, the physics informed and uninformed modular manoeuvring models are first introduced.
They have identical prediction models for the hull and propeller forces but different models for the rudder forces. The PI model has a new deterministic semi-empirical rudder model, as proposed in this paper (see \autoref{sec:semiempirical_rudder_model}). The PU model has a data-driven mathematical rudder model. 
Except for the changed rudder models, the ship manoeuvring models are similar to the MMG model \citep{yasukawa_introduction_2015}, with some minor enhancements that are presented in the next section.
