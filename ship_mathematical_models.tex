Two different rudder models are used in this paper: a mathematical rudder model, and a new semi-empirical rudder model.
One ship manoeuvring model is created for each rudder model, combining the rudder models with the same hull and propeller models, so that the rudder model is the only difference between the ship manoeuvring models.
The ship manoeuvring model equipped with the mathematical rudder model is referred to as the \emph{``Abkowitz model''}. The other model, equipped with the semi-empirical rudder, is referred to as the \emph{``Physics informed model''}. Except that the manoeuvring models have different rudder models, the rest of the models are similar to the MMG model \citep{yasukawa_introduction_2015}, with some exceptions that are be presented in the next section.
