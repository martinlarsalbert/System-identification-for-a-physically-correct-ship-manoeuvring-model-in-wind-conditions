The parameters within the models were identified (see \autoref{tab:parameters}): for the Reference model with VCT regression, for the Abkowitz, and the Physics informed model with inverse dynamics regression (as described in the methodology \autoref{sec:methodology}).

The validations of these identified models and a closer examination of the identified parameters are presented in this section; The Reference model is compared with the VCT data in \autoref{sec:result_VCT}; All of the models are compared with: the manoeuvring model tests in \autoref{sec:result_MDL}, and with an idealized wind condition in \autoref{sec:wind_state}.
