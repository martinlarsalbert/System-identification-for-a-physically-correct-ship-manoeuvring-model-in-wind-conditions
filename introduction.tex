A captive model test is the classic type of experiment used in ship hydrodynamics to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients of a shipâ€™s hull, rudder, and propeller. The test is conducted by towing a model of the ship in a towing tank or a maneuvering basin. The model is held stationary while the water is made to flow around it. The hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the model are measured and used to calculate the coefficients.
