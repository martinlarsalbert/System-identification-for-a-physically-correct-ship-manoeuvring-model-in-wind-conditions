\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It was not possible to identify an Abkowitz model that makes sense from a physical point of view based on inverse dynamics forces from the standard manoeuvres used in this paper. This was revealed when the regressed model was compared with the CFD based VCT regression model.
    \item The yawing moment $N_D$ from the Abkowitz model was completely wrong in an idealized wind state.
    \item A pure mathematical model which has been identified on calm water standard manoeuvres can therefore be expected to have a poor generalization into a wind condition.   
    \item The introduction of a semi-empirical rudder model guided the identification toward a more physically correct model, which produced forces that were closer to the VCT reference model. The Semi-empirical model should therefore have a better generalization into a wind condition.
\end{itemize}
